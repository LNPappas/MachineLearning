#Machine Learning automates analytical model building
# algorithms iteratively learn from data
# allows computers to find hidden insights without programming

#Supervised Learning algorithms trained using labeled examples
# where desired output is known.

#Overfitting training too much on a specific training set 

#Epoch - passing training data through 1 time on the model

#f1 score(harmonic mean) = 2*((precision*recall)/precision+recall))
